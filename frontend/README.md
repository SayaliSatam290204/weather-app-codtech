# Frontend — Weather App (React)

This directory contains the React frontend for the Weather App (CRA-style structure).

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Start development server

```bash
npm start
```

The dev server runs on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` — start dev server
- `npm run build` — create production build in `build/`
- `npm test` — run tests
- `npm run eject` — eject (only if created with CRA and you need full control)

## Proxy / API

During development the frontend may proxy API requests to the backend. If your backend is running on a different port, set the `proxy` field in `frontend/package.json` to `http://localhost:5000` (or your backend URL).

## Environment

- For environment-specific configuration, use `.env` files per Create React App conventions (e.g., `.env.development`, `.env.production`). Prefix variables with `REACT_APP_` to make them available to the app.

Example (frontend/.env.development):

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

## Deployment

Build the app and serve the static files with any static host or integrate into the backend server.

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
# then serve `build/` with your static server or copy into backend `public/` path
```

## Notes

- Check `src/components/` for UI and data-fetching flow.
- If you add environment variables, restart the dev server to pick them up.
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
